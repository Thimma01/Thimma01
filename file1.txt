1. FBA Ending Stock Calculation (for each month):
For Jan 01 (Month 1), calculate the FBA ending stock after shipment and 30 days of demand:

FBA Ending Stock = FBA Starting Stock + Units Shipped to FBA - (Average Daily Demand * 30)



2. Warehouse Ending Stock Calculation (for each month):
Subtract the shipped units from the warehouse starting stock:

Warehouse Ending Stock = Warehouse Starting Stock - Units Shipped to FBA



3. Month 2 Starting Stock:
For February and March, the starting stock for FBA and the warehouse is the ending stock from the previous month:

FBA Starting Stock (Feb) = FBA Ending Stock (Jan)
Warehouse Starting Stock (Feb) = Warehouse Ending Stock (Jan)
