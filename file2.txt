Hello Bhanu, How are you doing?
Hello Teja all good, How are you doing?
Yes, perfect here, I am leaving the city for two weeks this sunday.
Oh that's great, Where are you heading to?
I am going to London.
Get something for me from London, don't bring Effile tower, I can't place it in my home...

Have a wonderful journey, take care.
